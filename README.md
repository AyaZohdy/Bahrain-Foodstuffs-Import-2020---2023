# Bahrain-Foodstuffs-Import-2020-2023

Bahrain is a major food importer, its primary partners for food products are countries like Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Turkey. I did this Dashboard to track the foodstuffs from 2020 to 2023.

# Findings:

1. Bahrain's general imports decreased in 2021

   â€¢ The impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic: The global COVID-19 pandemic, which extended into 2021, significantly disrupted international trade and supply chains.

3. Increased Cigarette Imports from Poland
   1.	Cost-Effectiveness and Tax Advantages: Polish tobacco products might be more cost-effective due to lower production costs and competitive pricing. (https://www.gao.gov/blog/tobacco-tax-revenue-has-gone-smoke-and-not-entirely-reason-you-think)
   2.	Economic and Logistical Factors: Poland's stable economic growth and investment in logistics might enhance its ability to export tobacco products efficiently.
   3.	Consumer Preferences: Consumer shift towards roll-your-own (RYO) tobacco products. Poland, as a significant tobacco producer in the EU, might be catering to this niche with affordable RYO options, thereby driving import growth.
